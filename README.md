<!-- INSPIRATION -->
## Inspiration
We know that many people have their own problems and that having someone to talk to would mean the world to them. However, they avoid speaking about their feelings because of insecurity, anxiety, or fear, and instead, stay silent. This is why we wanted to provide a safe space for users to share their thoughts, advise others, and spread overall positivity. We wanted to create something that would allow users to speak out about their problems without fear of being judged or ridiculed.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Sentiment Analysis API (Google Cloud)
- We leveraged the power of Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Sentiment Analysis API to identify and prevent negative or toxic content from being posted by users. 
## GCP Entities API (Google Cloud)
- We also used the GCP Entities API to protect the privacy of our users by detecting sensitive information such as names, locations, and contact details.
